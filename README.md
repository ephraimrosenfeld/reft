Sample project to learn Python, Flask, and NLTK.
REFT (Relational Extraction Flask Tool) is a simple web
application to upload documents and text and to record
any relational-entities it finds.

The Flask application is based on Flask's sample application
tutorial (http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/tutorial/#tutorial).

Relational extraction is based on Ch. 07 of the NLTK book
(http://www.nltk.org/book/ch07.html).
